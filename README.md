audiosearchengine
=================

Search for audio .wav files based on percent match in the audio file database

You can run either interfaceCLI.py and interfaceGUI.py. interfaceCLI.py is for
command line use and interfaceGUI.py is for GUI. On the GUI application,
you can also compare the two waveforms.

Place query wav file in the top level directory where interfaceCLI.py is stored.
Run search by running interfaceCLI.py. You can also add .wav files to the
db directory (database). 

Please note that the algorithm is designed for Python Version 3.X.X. (interfaceCLI.py).

If possible, run interfaceCLI.py with python3.
