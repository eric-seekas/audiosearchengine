audiosearchengine
=================

Search for audio .wav files based on percent match in the audio file database

Place query wav file in the top level directory (e.g. button.py and beep-10.py)
Run search by running interfacePython3Plus.py

Please note that the algorithm is designed for Python Version 3+ (interfacePython3Plus.py),
although I have made a separate interface file for Python Version 2.X.X. (interface.py)
it cannot be guaranteed that all of the modules compatible with Version 3.X.X
will behave exactly as intended in the older version.
