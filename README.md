audiosearchengine
=================

Search for audio .wav files based on percent match in the audio file database

Place query wav file in the top level directory where interfacePython3Plus.py is stored.
Run search by running interfacePython3Plus.py. You can also add .wav files to the
db directory (database). 

Please note that the algorithm is designed for Python Version 3.X.X. (interfacePython3Plus.py).
Although, a separate interface file for Python Version 2.X.X. (interface.py) was made
it cannot be guaranteed that all of the modules and built-in functions compatible with Version 3.X.X
will behave exactly as intended in the older version of Python.

If possible, run interfacePython3Plus.py with python3 command.
