Time Complexity Analysis
	Serial Method	
	Overall						O(l*n*k)
	for query in list_of_queries:			O(l*n*k) l is the size of list_of_queries
		for haystack in list_of_haystack	O(n*k) 	 n is the DB size (haystacks)
			for i in range(len(haystack)):	O(k*1) 	 (worst case k is the size of haystack)
				Append if match		O(1)
		Extend Emission List 			O(n*k)   k is the size of haystack
	Reduce Step					O(l*n)
	

	Multiprocess Method

	Overall						O(n*max(k,l))
	for query in list_of_queries:			O   (theoretical) multiprocess step
							(if n is sufficiently small,
							and l is sufficiently large, O ~ O(l*n*k)
							due to overhead cost of setting up processes
							(if n is sufficiently large,
							and l is relatively small, O ~ O(n*k)
							the overhead cost is insignificant compared
							to the runtime of each process unit
		for haystack in list_of_haystack	O(n*k) 	 n is the DB size (haystacks)
